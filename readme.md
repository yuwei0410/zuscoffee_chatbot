# ZUS Coffee AI Chatbot

A multi-tool AI assistant for ZUS Coffee, powered by a LangGraph agent. This chatbot can answer questions about products using a RAG pipeline, find store locations using Text2SQL, and perform calculations.

This project uses architecture with two main Python servers and a Vue.js frontend.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project consists of three separate components that communicate via API calls.

1.  **Vue.js Frontend (Client)**
    * The user interface that the user interacts with.
    * Runs on `http://localhost:5173`.
    * It sends all user messages to the **Agent Server**.

2.  **Agent Server (`planner.py`)**
    * This is the "brain" of the operation, built with **LangGraph** and **FastAPI**.
    * Runs on `http://localhost:8001`.
    * It receives a query from the Vue app (e.g., "Where are stores in KL?").
    * It uses a planner LLM (**meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct**) to decide *which tool* to use.
    * It does **not** execute the tools itself. Instead, it calls the **Tools Server**.

3.  **Tools Server (`main.py`)**
    * This is the "workhorse" of the operation, built with **FastAPI**.
    * Runs on `http://localhost:8000`.
    * It exposes the actual tools as API endpoints:
        * `POST /products`: A RAG pipeline using **FAISS** and **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** to answer product questions.
        * `GET /outlets`: A Text2SQL pipeline using a **Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Text-to-SQL** model to query a SQLite database.
        * `GET /calculator`: A simple, secured `eval()` endpoint for math.

### Request Flow
[User @ Vue App] -> [POST /chat] -> [**Agent Server @ 8001**] -> [**Tools Server @ 8000**]
                                     (1. "I need the outlets_tool")   (2. Calls GET /outlets)
                                     (4. Gets JSON, formats answer)   (3. Runs Text2SQL, returns JSON)
                                     (5. Sends final answer to User)

## ✨ Key Features

* **Product RAG:** Answers natural language questions about ZUS Coffee products, merchandise, and drinkware.
* **Outlet Text2SQL:** Finds store locations, addresses, and opening hours by converting user queries (e.g., "stores in Petaling Jaya") directly into SQL queries.
* **Agentic Routing:** Uses a `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model as a planner to intelligently route the user's request to the correct tool.
* **Conversational Memory:** Remembers the context of the conversation using `langgraph.checkpoint.MemorySaver` to allow for follow-up questions.
* **Decoupled API:** Fully decoupled agent and tool servers, allowing them to be scaled or updated independently.
